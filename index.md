Computers are my life. Since receiving a my-first-QBasic book from my computer teacher in first grade, I've been fascinated by everything programming - the fast-growing capabilities of the web, the immense power of distributed databases, cross-process synchronization in parallel programming, low-level memory management, and high-level programming techniques and methods of approaching problems, to give a few examples.

I am constantly picking up new languages and frameworks to satisfy my curiosity - the list on this page is a testament to that! - and recently, that tendency has extended to human languages, as well, with Japanese. So it is that as I decide to try living away from my birthplace of New York, I'm moving to Tokyo to further my interest in Japanese and in Japan.

I'm looking to continue my software engineering journey while I'm there. I want to work on interesting, meaningful problems in a close-knit, team-based environment. If your company might be that environment, give me an email or a call!
