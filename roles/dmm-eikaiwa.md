Since I first discovered HTML in elementary school, the potential of the web has drawn me - even more so as browsers became more and more capable. Front-end work has always had a special appeal to me as a result, with many of my personal projects being web projects. And when I learned about automated testing at one of my first internships, it gripped me, and I worked for years at Google as a software engineer in test, helping make tests come to life.

As a lover of language - the structured elegance of programming languages, the familiar chaos of English, and now the yet-unfamiliar-but-fascinating world of Japanese - I'm eager to put my testing and web-dev chops to work helping to teach the world new languages!
