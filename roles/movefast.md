Since I first discovered HTML in elementary school, the potential of the web has drawn me - even more so as browsers became more and more capable. Front-end work has always had a special appeal to me as a result, with many of my personal projects being web projects. And when I learned about automated testing at one of my first internships, it gripped me, and I worked for years at Google as a software engineer in test, helping make tests come to life. I'm looking to put these skills to work in helping encourage curiosity and connections between people and cultures - something that is always important to me, but has become especially so in these divided times!
