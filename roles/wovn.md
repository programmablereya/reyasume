Since I first discovered HTML in elementary school, the potential of the web has drawn me - even more so as browsers became more and more capable. Front-end work has always had a special appeal to me as a result, with many of my personal projects being web projects. But so far only at work, on the back-end, have I been able to sink my teeth into big design problems.

In recent times, I've leaned heavily into my love of languages - not only programming but natural languages as well - and I'm hoping to pursue that love at work as I move on to new things. I want to help the world communicate!
