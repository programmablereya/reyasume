Since I first discovered HTML in elementary school, the potential of the web has drawn me - even more so as browsers became more and more capable. Front-end work has always had a special appeal to me as a result, with many of my personal projects being web projects. On every level - from the internals of the network protocols to the details of browser rendering - web apps in particular and networked apps in general fascinate me.

In part because of the technology involved, but in part because of the way they bring people together across cities, countries, the whole world. Communication is one of my core values, and I look forward to bringing my values and skills to my next team!
