Databases have always fascinated me from the moment - in my novice Visual Basic 6 experimentation back in third grade! - I first learned about them through the presence of the databinding controls. Learning about NoSQL, serverless, and distributed databases further fed my curiosity, and I'm constantly impressed by the features and stability improvements of databases as time goes on.

I've been working on engineering productivity and testing improvements at Google for eight years, and am looking forward to putting this expertise to work on paving the way for databases to grow even further!
