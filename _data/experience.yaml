      Let's see here.
      What did I do on Configurability?
      Besides _endless_ amounts of **trimming**?
    achievements:
      # * PB: Personal postmortem for burnout
      # * Organizer for BazelCon 2018
      # * PB: Really easy to understand configuration trimming document ("one of the best docs I've read at Google")
      # * PB: BazelCon 2018 office hours, copy editing, logistics
      # * Worked to improve configurability team culture
      # * Helped teach other Bazel developers about Bazel configurability - multiple Bazel U sessions
      # * Bazel Android support: feature flags
      #   * "This is so much better it hurts." - from attribute code refactoring as part of this
      #   * Whitelisting mechanism as part of this, used by another developer for another feature
      # * Bazel configurability: manual trimming design + rollout
      #   * Test trimming (saved 5min+ recompile on every test flag change)
      #   * Tagged trimming (design + migration tool + rollout - for example, a project with 5GB memory use that had ballooned to 10+ GB and OOM-ing could drop down to a very buildable 8GB)
      # * Bazel configurability: automatic trimming research
      #   * 2 years, ~60 pages of design documents, 2 different prototypes
      # * PB: Helped others understand Bazel feature flags
